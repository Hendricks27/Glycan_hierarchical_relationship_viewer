    <h3>How to use the lib</h3>
    <p>1. First put 3 script tags for this JavaScript widget, d3 library and vis v4.19.1 (Please use v4.19.1) in head part of your HTML.
        <br>For the d3 and vis, I recommend you just use script from CDN, so you don't necessarily need to save a local copy.
        <br>Put a style tag for vis in the head part of your HTML.</p>
    <p>2. Create a empty div with id. This is the place where I will put my widget in.</p>
    <p>3. Create a parameter JavaScript Object, and pass it to glycanview_new.init(para_obj);</p>
